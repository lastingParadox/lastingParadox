Hello, I'm Zander Preston, aka lastingParadox.
-----------------------
- I am a UCF Computational Physics Major, second year.
- I'm learning various programming languages both as a hobby and for eventual research in computational physics.
- This is my first year in github, so expect a lot more projects to be made!
